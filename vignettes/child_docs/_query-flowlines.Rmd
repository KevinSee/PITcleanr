The user may also be interested in getting the flowlines (i.e., the stream or river network), for their sites of interest. `PITcleanr` provide the function `queryFlowlines()` to accomplish that. `queryFlowlines()` downloads an [NHDPlus v2](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/nhdplus-national-hydrography-dataset-plus) stream layer from USGS using the suggested `nhdplusTools` R package. It requires the spatial location of sites as an `sf` object (such as the output of `extractSites()`), and a site code identified as the "root" site. The root site might correspond with your tagging or release location and is provided to the `root_site_code` argument. The function starts from the `root_site_code` and downloads all flowlines upstream from there, with a minimum stream order set by `min_strm_order`. 

If there are sites downstream of the `root_site_code` site in the users site list, downstream flowlines will also be downloaded. By default, the upstream and downstream flowlines will be combined into a single `sf` object. However, if the user would like to keep them separated, they can set the argument `combine_up_down` to `FALSE`, and the downstream flowlines will be returned as a separate element.

The `queryFlowlines()` function returns a list consisting of:

* `flowlines`: the flowlines upstream of the `root_site_code` (and possibly the downstream ones as well)
* `basin`: the polygon containing the upstream flowlines

The default option (`combine_up_down = TRUE`) like to combine the flowlines upstream and downstream of the root site. If the user sets `combine_up_down == FALSE`, the function will return a third element in the list called:

* `dwn_flowlines`: the flowlines downstream of the `root_site_code`.

Depending on the spatial extent of your flowlines, the `queryFlowlines()` function may take awhile. More information on the `nhdplusTools` R package can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nhdplusTools/index.html).

```{r get-flowlines}
# query the flowlines
nhd_list = queryFlowlines(sites_sf = sites_sf,
                          root_site_code = "TUM",
                          min_strm_order = 2)

# join the upstream and downstream flowlines
flowlines = nhd_list$flowlines

```
