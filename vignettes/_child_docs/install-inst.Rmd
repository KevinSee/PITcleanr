The `PITcleanr` package can be installed as an R package from GitHub by using Hadley Wickham's `devtools` package:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install and load remotes, if necessary
install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("KevinSee/PITcleanr", 
                         build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

`devtools` may require the downloading and installation of Rtools. The latest version of Rtools can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

For the latest development version:

```{r develop-version, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("KevinSee/PITcleanr@develop")
```

Alternatively, the `PITcleanr` compendium can be downloaded as a zip file from from this URL: <https://github.com/KevinSee/PITcleanr/archive/master.zip>
Once extracted, the functions can be sourced individually, or a user can build the R package locally.
