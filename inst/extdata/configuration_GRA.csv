LCL is operated by the Integrated Status and Effectiveness Project (ISEMP) cooperators Idaho Fish and Game and Quantitative Consultants, Inc. and was installed for continuous monitoring in December 2013. This site is powered by a 24 volt solar powered system and remote communication is provided by a cellular telephone modem.  Environmental conditions are monitored by air temperature, water temperature, and water depth sensors. The initial site configuration consisting of three antennas deployed about 10 meters apart was replaced in October 2016 with two 10 ft antennas deployed about 20 meters apart.

Lebanon Dam is located near Lebanon Oregon on the South Santiam River, a tributary to the Wilammette River. The array is one of four interrogation sites located at or near the dam. This site is monitored by two synchronized Biomark IS-1001-Master Controllers and 15x Biomark IS1001-ACNs. Additional hardware at the site includes cell modems for data-transfer, grid supplied power charging 24V battery-banks to isolate grid power from the Master Controller and serve as backup in the case of a power outage. The antenna configuration is a single line of fifteen antennas on the upstream sill of the Obemeyer Weir, each approximately twenty feet in length (efficiency estimates are not possible without direct tag-testing).

Initial configuration of the site included 3-20ft, Biomark Lite antennas, each spanning the wetted width of the creek. Antenna 1 is upstream, 2 middle, and 3 is the downstream antenna. Antennas 2 and 3 were damaged February 2016 and were replaced in February 2017 with 24 x 8 ft quadrilaterlas constructed with 1 inch PEX. Ten inch posts were used on the bottom of the creek to create a backbone for the antennas.  The posts are secured to the substrate with MR-4 anchors.  The sides of the antennas are secured using anchors on an exposed bank, clamps on trees and one t-post for antenna 3.  Antennas 2 and 3 have a complete field of detection with 24 inches of read range off the coil.  Each antenna is connected to a submersible IS1001 antenna control node which are anchored to the bank.

In October of 2018, the site was relocated 200’ below Lambert bridge, 5 miles east of Cle Elum Washington (47.174326, -120.836400).  The IS1001 MTS is powered by a 200 Ah 24V battery bank charged with a 24V, 8A Interacter charger which is connected to grid power.  There are two CAN bus trunk lines ~60’ long that are connected to the upper and lower rows of ACNs.  The submersible enclosures for the IS1001s were constructed by Yakama Nation Fisheries and consist of schedule 40 PVC with various fittings.  The submersibles were pressure tested to ensure a water tight enclosure.  They are located 8’ below each antenna and are daisy chained together.  Hydrovolt plugs are located between each submersible for the CAN bus cabling  and from submersible to antenna allowing each component to detatch under extreme flow conditions.  The CAN bus cabling is routed in a straight line 8’ below each row of antennas and is secured to 3/8” stainless steel cable using zip ties.  The stainless steel cable is secured to the substrate with MR-4 anchors, ~10’ apart.  Both rows of antennas consist of 3, 25’X30” HDPE flat plates constructed by Yakama Nation spanning the entire channel under most flow conditions.  The antennas are secured to the substrate using MR-4 anchors and a combination of NRS and ratchet straps. The site was installed in July 2018 by WDFW and Yakama Nation staff and started collecting data on 10/15/2018 at 13:15.",Instream Remote Detection System,539.284.000,823,47.174326,-120.8364

The readers are controlled by a Biomark IS1001-MC located in an enclosure on the shore.The antennas are anchored to the streambed with a “through-strut” method using DB-88 earth anchors attached to stainless steel threaded rod. The anchors are driven to a depth of 20-30 inches into the river bed. The IS1001 readers are connected to the MC by a single run of Biomark CAN-Bus cable. The readers are attached in series to the MC.

The antennas are anchored to the streambed with a through-strut method using DB-88 earth anchors attached to stainless steel threaded rod. The anchors are driven to a depth of 20-30 inches into the river bed. The IS1001 readers are connected to the IS1001-MC via Biomark CAN Bus cable. All cables are covered by flexible non-metallic conduit.  Power for the system is supplied by six 12V 115Ah batteries, these batteries are run in series-parallel to create 24V to power the IS1001-MC and provide approximately 7 days of runtime.The required permits are still pending to install the complete enclosure and connect the system to AC power via an Isolation Transformer and disconnect switch.

The electronics enclosure and battery box are located on the river right bank on the back side of a storage shed used by the camp host at Chinook Bay Campground.The site consists of four 20ft HDPE antennas, located in a single string across the river.  The antennas are constructed of fusion welded 4 inch HDPE pipe. Each antenna is driven by a Biomark IS1001 reader located in a submersible canister attached to the antenna. The readers are controlled by a Biomark IS1001-MC located in an enclosure on the shore.   The antennas are anchored to the streambed with a through-strut method using DB-88 earth anchors attached to stainless steel threaded rod. The anchors are driven to a depth of 20-30 inches into the river bed. The IS1001 readers are connected to the IS1001-MC via Biomark CAN Bus cable. All cables are covered by flexible non-metallic conduit.  Power for the system is supplied by six 12V 115Ah batteries, these batteries are run in series-parallel to create 24V to power the IS1001-MC and provide approximately 7 days of runtime.The required permits are still pending to install the complete enclosure and connect the system to AC power via an Isolation Transformer and disconnect switch. Until that time the system will be run off the above described battery system.",Instream Remote Detection System,522.303.615.001,1441,44.164727,-114.905043

The antennas in the fish ladder and downstream of the weir were added in December 2016 during a site overhaul that also included replacing the FS1001M transceiver with the IS1001-MC and the original 6 antennas. The site is connected to AC power and also includes a Campbell Scientific CR1000 data logger and remote communication via a satellite modem.",Instream Remote Detection System,522.100.059,681,46.309627,-117.657161
