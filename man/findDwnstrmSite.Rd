\usage{
findDwnstrmSite(site_id = NULL, flow_lines = NULL, sites_joined = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{site_id}{Site code for the starting detection site.}

\item{flow_lines}{An `sf` object containing the flowlines (output of `queryFlowlines()`). Must have a column name called Hydroseq with unique identifiers, and a column name called DnHydroseq containing the hydro sequence of the next downstream segment}

\item{sites_joined}{An `sf` class object containing points of all detection sites. Must contain a column named `site_code` containing the site code of each site, and a column called Hydroseq containing the hydro sequence closest to each site.}
}
\value{
character of the site code downstream
}
\description{
Determine which detection site is the closest downstream site from a starting site, based on hydrographic flowlines
