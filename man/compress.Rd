\title{Compress PTAGIS Data}
\usage{
compress(
  ptagis_file = NULL,
  max_minutes = NA,
  configuration = NULL,
  units = c("mins", "auto", "secs", "hours", "days", "weeks"),
  ignore_event_vs_release = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ptagis_file}{is the path to the PTAGIS observation file downloaded as a csv from PTAGIS.
This must be the output from a Complete Tag History query (part of the Advanced Reporting).
This query should contain: Tag, Mark Species, Mark Rear Type, Event Type, Event Site Type,
Event Site Code, Event Date Time, Antenna, Antenna Group Configuration,
Event Release Site Code, and Event Release Date Time.}

\item{max_minutes}{maximum number of minutes between detections of a tag before it's considered a
different "slot" of detections. Default is `NA`, which means a new slot is only defined by
detections on a new node.}

\item{configuration}{is a data frame which assigns node names to unique SiteID, AntennaID, and
site configuration ID combinations. One example can be built with the function `buildConfig`. If
no configuration file is provided, nodes are considered site codes by default. If nodes are assigned,
the column name should be `node`.}

\item{units}{character string.  Units in which the results are
    desired.  Can be abbreviated.}

\item{ignore_event_vs_release}{Should the function attempt to choose whether to use the event time value
or the event release time value for different release batches? Default is `FALSE`. If set to `TRUE`,
the event time value will be used}
}
\value{
a tibble
}
\description{
The function takes complete capture histories downloaded from PTAGIS
and compresses them. This involves assigning nodes to the detection locations (e.g.
sites, arrays, antennas, etc.), and summarizing the first and last detection time on
each node as well as how many detections were made during that slot. Slots can be
defined to include a maximum number of minutes, or not.
