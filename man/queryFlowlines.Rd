\usage{
queryFlowlines(
  sites_sf = NULL,
  root_site_code = NULL,
  min_strm_order = 0,
  dwnstrm_sites = FALSE,
  dwn_min_stream_order_diff = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sites_sf}{An `sf` class object containing points of all detection sites. Must contain a column named `site_code` containing the site code of each site.}

\item{root_site_code}{Site code for the starting detection site.}

\item{min_strm_order}{minimum stream order to query flowlines for. Default value is `0`.}

\item{dwn_min_stream_order_diff}{Used to control the minimum stream order of downloaded downstream flowlines. This can be useful if the user wants to prevent downloading excessive smaller streams downstream of a tagging or release location. It corresponds to the difference between the stream order of the `root_site_code` site and the minimum stream order desired in the downstream flowlines. For example, if the `root_site_code` is located on a stream order 6 and `dwn_min_stream_order_diff = 2`, then only flowlines of at least 6-2=**4** will be downloaded. The default value is 0, meaning only streams of equal or greater order than the tagging or release site will be returned.}

\item{dwnstream_sites}{Does `sites_sf` contain sites that are downstream of `root_site_code`? If `TRUE`, then all flowlines within a boundary box of `sites_df` will be downloaded}
