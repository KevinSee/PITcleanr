## Description

`PITcleanr` is an R package for preparing PIT tag data for further analysis. The package can help import complete tag histories from [PTAGIS](https://www.ptagis.org/), build a configuration file to help assign each detection to a "node", and compress those detections into a smaller file. It contains functions to determine which detection locations are upstream or downstream of each other, build a parent-child relationship table describing whether detection locations are upstream or downstream in relation to each other, and assign directionality of movement between each detection location. For analyses that focus on one-way directional movement (e.g., straightforward CJS models), `PITcleanr` can help determine which detections fail to meet that one-way movement assumption and should be examined more closely, and which detections can be kept. 

It was originally conceived as a companion to the [DABOM](https://github.com/KevinSee/DABOM) package for estimating abundance of returning anadromous adult fish moving upstream. `PITcleanr` was designed to prepare the raw PIT tag observations from [PTAGIS](https://www.ptagis.org/) for use in the `DABOM` package.

The user can find more information related to installation and use of this package on the [package website](https://kevinsee.github.io/PITcleanr/).

## Installation Instructions

```{r child = "vignettes/child_docs/_install-inst.Rmd"}
```

Be sure to use the `build_vignettes = TRUE` argument, as this will build all of the vignettes (i.e., user manuals) that are included with the package. Further instructions on how to use `PITcleanr` can be found in the vignettes, which can be accessed using:

```{r, eval = F}
browseVignettes(package = "PITcleanr")
```

<!-- ## Compressing PTAGIS Detection Data -->

<!-- ```{r set-ptagis-file, echo = F} -->
<!-- library(PITcleanr) -->
<!-- ptagis_file = system.file("extdata",  -->
<!--                           "TUM_Chinook_2015.csv",  -->
<!--                           package = "PITcleanr", -->
<!--                           mustWork = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ```{r, eval = T, child = "vignettes/compress_data.Rmd"} -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Other Functionality -->

<!-- `PITcleanr` contains lots of additional functionality to help users summarize and further analyze the compressed PTAGIS observations. Find more details in the various vignettes. -->
