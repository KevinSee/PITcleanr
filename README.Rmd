## Description

`PITcleanr` is an R package for preparing PIT tag data for further analysis. It was originally conceived as a companion to the [DABOM](https://github.com/BiomarkABS/DABOM) package for estimating abundance of returning anadromous adult fish moving upstream. `PITcleanr` was designed to prepare the raw PIT tag observations from [PTAGIS](http://www.ptagis.org) for use in the DABOM package.

## Installation instructions

To install `PITcleanr` you can use Hadley Wickham's `devtools` package. To install and load the devtools package use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

NOTE: To use devtools, you may also have to download and install Rtools (although you shouldn't). The latest version on Rtools can be found at https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
  
You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL: <https://github.com/BiomarkABS/PITcleanr/archive/master.zip>

Or you can install this compendium as an R package, DABOM, from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("BiomarkABS/PITcleanr", 
                        dependencies = TRUE,
                        build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

For the latest development version:
```{r develop-version, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("BiomarkABS/PITcleanr@develop", 
                        dependencies = TRUE,
                        build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

To look at the various vignettes:

```{r show-vignettes, eval = F}
browseVignettes("PITcleanr")
```
