## Description

`PITcleanr` is an R package for preparing PIT tag data for further analysis. It was originally conceived as a companion to the [DABOM](https://github.com/BiomarkABS/DABOM) package for estimating abundance of returning anadromous adult fish moving upstream. `PITcleanr` was designed to prepare the raw PIT tag observations from [PTAGIS](http://www.ptagis.org) for use in the `DABOM` package.

## Installation Instructions

The `PITcleanr` compendium can be downloaded as a zip from from this URL: <https://github.com/BiomarkABS/PITcleanr/archive/master.zip>

Or you can install the compendium as an R package using `remotes` from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install and load remotes, if necessary
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)

remotes::install_github("BiomarkABS/PITcleanr", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Be sure to use the `build_vignettes = TRUE` argument, as this will build all of the vignettes (i.e., user manuals) that are included with the package. Further instructions on how to use PITcleanr can be found in the vignettes, which can be accessed using:

```{r}
browseVignettes(package = "PITcleanr")
```


For the latest development version:

```{r develop-version, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("BiomarkABS/PITcleanr@develop", 
                        dependencies = TRUE,
                        build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Developers Note

`PITcleanr` can alternatively be installed using Hadley Wickham's `devtools` package, which can be installed and loaded using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

`devtools` may require the downloading and installation of Rtools. The latest version of Rtools can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
